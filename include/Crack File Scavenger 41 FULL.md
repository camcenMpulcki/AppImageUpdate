If you have, you know how frustrating and stressful it can be to lose your important data. But don't panic, there is a solution: File Scavenger 4.1.
 
File Scavenger 4.1 is a powerful data recovery software that can help you recover deleted files from Windows, Linux, Mac, and virtual file systems. It can recover files from hard disks, memory cards, flash drives, RAID, NAS, and more. It can also recover files from corrupted or reformatted volumes, even when the original position and size are unknown.
 
In this article, we will show you how to use File Scavenger 4.1 to recover your deleted files in a few simple steps.
 
## Step 1: Download and install File Scavenger 4.1
 
You can download File Scavenger 4.1 from the official website of QueTek Consulting Corporation, the developer of the software. The download link is [http://www.quetek.com/prod02.htm](http://www.quetek.com/prod02.htm).
 
The software is compatible with Windows 10/8/7/Vista, Server 2016/2012/2008, XP and 2000. It supports both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows.
 
When you run the installer, you have the option to either install the software to disk or run it straight away. If you want to recover files from the same drive where you want to install the software, it is better to run it straight away without installing it. This will prevent overwriting any deleted files that may still exist on the drive.
 
However, if you run the software without installing it, you will need to provide your license code every time you use it. You can purchase a license code from the website for $49.95 for personal edition, $89 for personal edition with RAID reconstruction, or $185 for professional edition.
 
## Step 2: Select the drive or volume where you want to recover files
 
When you launch File Scavenger 4.1, you will see a simple interface with two tabs: Search and Recover.
 
The Search tab allows you to select the drive or volume where you want to recover files. You can choose from physical drives (such as C:, D:, etc.), logical drives (such as NTFS, FAT32, etc.), or image files (such as VMDK, VHD, etc.).
 
If you are not sure which drive or volume contains your deleted files, you can select All Drives and scan the entire physical hard drive for traces of defunct volumes.
 
## Step 3: Choose the scan mode and start scanning
 
After selecting the drive or volume where you want to recover files, you need to choose the scan mode from the drop-down menu below the drive list.
 
There are four scan modes available:
 
- Quick: This mode scans only the file system structures and recovers files that have been recently deleted or have not been overwritten by new data.
- Long: This mode scans both the file system structures and the free space of the drive or volume and recovers files that have been deleted long ago or have been partially overwritten by new data.
- Full: This mode scans both the file system structures and the entire space of the drive or volume and recovers files that have been deleted long ago or have been completely overwritten by new data.
- Disk Imager: This mode creates an image file of the drive or volume that can be used for later recovery or analysis.

The scan mode that you choose depends on how much time you have and how much data you
